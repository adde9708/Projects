# Ada Super Computer

This is an open source Free program/script C:

Project name: **Ada Super Computer**

This project contains:

1. A .py file (the program itself)
2. A .txt file (The synthesized voice where, later on it, reads out loud the name of the program)
3. A .txt file (The synthesized voice where, it later on, reads out loud the percentage from 1 to 99 (x5)
4. A .txt file with all the requirements needed, to use the code itself
5. A .md file with all the information (ReadME)
6. To get the requirements You can choose either **METHOD A** or **METHOD B**
7. A .mp3 file with the saved synthesized voice (Name of Program)
8. A .mp3 file with the saved synthesized voice (Percentage)
9. SoundFX
10. Character project Logotype
11. Assets where it stores most of the soundsFX and Music
12. Updated the License

**METHOD A**

1. Open a Terminal
2. Use command: pip install "NAME OF MODULE"
   Check "requirements.txt" for the listed required Modules.

   To install all the requirements at the same time.

Just click on the .exe file and enjoy! C:

A friend of mine tried to download it and his antivirus Norton flagged the file as "wisdom of the crowds"!

This is the definition in quotes:

"The reputation-based system uses "the wisdom of crowds" (Symantecâ€™s tens of millions of end-users)
connected to cloud-based intelligence to compute a reputation score for an application, and in the
process identify malicious software in an entirely new way beyond traditional signatures and
behavior-based detection techniques."

It's nothing to worry about! Python (.py) programming has sadly been flagged as a bad reputation program
since people have been using this "easy" way of programming, to program viruses/malware/badware.

This is the proof that my program is virus-free:
